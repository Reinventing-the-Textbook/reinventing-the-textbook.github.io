Why are hypertext books not more common?


- Monetization problem. How can hypertext books be monetized?

- Chicken-Egg problem. 
>"No one understands what a hypertext book is, because there are so few of them; there are few because the tools are inadequate; there’s no demand for better tools because no one wants to write hypertext books, because no one can read them…." [David Chapman](https://twitter.com/Meaningness/status/1154827701754007552)
- Lack of imagination problem. 
> "When digital filters first arose they were viewed merely as a variant of the classical analog filters; people did not see them as essentially new and different. This is exactly the same mistake which was made endlessly by people in the early days of computers. I was told repeatedly, until I was sick of hearing it, computers were nothing more than large, fast desk calculators. "Anything you can do by a machine you can do by hand.", so they said. This simply ignores the speed, accuracy, reliability, and lower costs of the machines vs. humans. Typically a single order of magnitude change (a factor of 10) produces fundamentally new effects, and computers are many, many times faster than hand computations. Those who claimed there was no essential difference never made any signficicant contributions to the development of computers... This is a common, endlessly made, mistake; people always want to think that something new is just like the past -- they like to be comfortable in their minds as well as their bodies -- and hence they prevent themselves from making any significant contribution to the new field being created under their noses." - Richard Hamming in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering
- Hypertext reading UX has  many challenges and is generally perceived as unpleasant.
