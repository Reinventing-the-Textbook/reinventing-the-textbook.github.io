# Desirable Difficulties

* **[Sans forgetica](https://sansforgetica.rmit/)** is a font that is intentionally somewhat hard to read. The idea is that this helps readers to focus on the text. It is an example of what in the literature is called an perceptual desirable difficulty.

In a hypertext book, these kind of desirable difficulties could be turned on and off on-demand.
