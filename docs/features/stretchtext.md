# Prompts

Stretchtext gives readers control in determining what level of detail they want to read a given text. Initially, only short summary-like text is shown. By clicking on certain parts of the text further details can be revealed. An interesting possibility is to hide details most steps in calculations and show them only on-demand. This way the text remains concise but still all details can be retrieved if necessary.
