* “The style of [Literary Machines] was pure Nelson: it had one Chapter Zero, seven Chapter Ones, one Chapter Two, and seven Chapter Threes. In his introduction, Nelson suggested that the reader begin with one of the Chapter Ones, then read Chapter Two, then explore a Chapter Three, and then start again, passing repeatedly through Chapter Two. He also provided a diagram, with the comment: "Pretzel or infinity, it's up to you."” - Gary Wolf, [*The Curse of Xanadu*](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/)
