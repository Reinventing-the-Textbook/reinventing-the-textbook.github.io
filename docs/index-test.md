    <em>Adapted from Dream Machines by Ted Nelson</em> 
</p>

The creation of this site is motivated by two observations: 

1. Computer Lib / Dream Machines by Ted Nelson is half a century old but almost no one writes hypertext books. 
2. It hardly got any easier to learn a challenging subject like quantum field theory compared to half a century ago. 

This is astonishing because hypertext books have the potential to revolutionize the way we understand challenging subjects. Moreover, nowadays it's easy to implement almost any imaginable feature and yet no one makes use of these possibilities.
