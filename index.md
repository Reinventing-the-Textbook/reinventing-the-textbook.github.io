# It's time for evidence-informed teaching and learning

Although we live in the 21. century, reading a textbook [is still the best strategy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject) to understand a challenging subject. But what are the odds that a century-old medium is the best we can come up with?

Is a linear series of pages, divided into pre-defined chapters, with a few exercises sprinkled in-between really the optimum?

While in past there were admittely limited possibilities to invent new media, nowadays it's only a lack of imagination that is stopping us. We need coders, designers, teachers, and researchers to reimagine the future of learning.
