Although we live in the 21. century, reading a textbook [is still the best strategy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject) to understand a challenging subject. But what are the odds that a century-old medium is the best we can come up with?

Is a sequence of pages, divided into pre-defined chapters, with possibly a few exercises sprinkled in-between really the optimum?

While in past there were admittely limited possibilities to invent new media, nowadays it's only a lack of imagination that is stopping us.
