# It's time for evidence-informed teaching and learning

Although we live in the 21. century, reading a textbook [is still the best strategy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject) to understand a challenging subject deeply. But what are the odds that a century-old medium is the best we can come up with?

Is a linear series of pages, separated into pre-defined chapter, with a few exercises sprinkled in-between really the optimum?

While in past there were admittely limited possibilities to invent a new medium, nowadays it's only a lack of imagination that is stopping us. We need coders, designers, teachers, and researchers to reimagine the future of learning.

> It matters because we live in media, as fish live in water. (Many people are prisoners of the media, many are manipulators, and many want to use them to communicate artistic visions.) But today, at this moment, we can and must design the media, design the molecules of our new water, and I believe the details of this design matter very deeply. They will be with us for a very long time, perhaps as long as man has left; perhaps if they are as good as they can be, man may buy even more timeâ€” or the open-ended future most suppose remains. - Ted Nelson, Dream Machines
